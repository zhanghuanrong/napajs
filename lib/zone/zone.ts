///     1) Broadcast - run code that changes worker state on all workers, returning a promise for pending operation. 
///        Through the promise, we can only know if operation succeed or failed. Usually we use `broadcast` to bootstrap
///        application, pre-cache objects, or change application settings.
///     2) Execute - run code that doesn't change worker state on an arbitrary worker, returning a promise of getting the result.
///        Execute is designed for doing the real work.
/// 
///     Zone operations are on a basis of first-come-first-serve, while `broadcast` takes higher priority over `execute`.
